// This file holds the one-shot migrations that bring a config written by an
// older release - web_config.json and the .conf files it points at - up to
// what the current code expects. They run at startup, from manager.New,
// before anything reads the config for real.
//
// To add one:
//
//   - bump SchemaVersion to the revision the migration produces and describe
//     that revision in the list on it;
//   - give the migration its own constant holding that same revision, open
//     its body with "if cfg.SchemaVersion >= <that constant> { return }" so a
//     later bump cannot re-run it, and call it from Migrate.

// SchemaVersion is the current web_config.json schema revision.
//
//	3 - the shape the first release writes: every client lives in the Clients
//	    list of its server, and every peer marker in a server .conf carries
//	    the client ID.
//	4 - every client's ServerID actually names the server it lives in; see
//	    repairClientServerIDs.
//
// It starts at 3 rather than 1 because pre-release builds already stamped 1
// and 2 into deployed configs. Numbering the first release below what is
// already on disk would make those files look newer than the code, and the
// next migration - guarded by "the config is older than this revision" -
// would never run on them.

// Migrate applies every migration cfg still needs and stamps the result, so
// none of them run twice. It reports whether cfg changed and therefore needs
// saving; a config that is already current is left untouched.

// repairClientServerIDs rewrites every client's ServerID from the server it is
// stored under.
//
// Releases up to 3.1.4 took that id straight from the route parameter and kept
// it, but fiber hands route parameters back as strings pointing into the
// request buffer it recycles the moment the handler returns. The id therefore
// decayed into a slice of some later request ("tatus5" off a /api/system/status
// path, "i-sett" off an .../i-settings one) and any save after that wrote the
// garbage to disk. Membership in the server's Clients list is what actually
// binds a client to its server, so the correct value is always to hand and
// nothing else needs repairing.
